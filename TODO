Implement output of option 245 from "dhcpcd -U IFACE".

Fixup the requirement for /etc/openssl/openssl.cnf. The "openssl req"
command needs that file and we don't have it. We should be able to set
OPENSSL_CONF or OPENSSL_CONFIG to /dev/null in the environment.

Tidy up the MAC address learning code to use "ifconfig -lb".

Everything else.
